//  Chapter 5 - Math expressions: Familiar operators
//  ================================================

//  1.Enter the operators, in this order, for addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
//  and division. Don't type spaces between them.
//  Answer:
//  +-*/

//  2. What is the name of the arithmetic operator that gives you the remainder when 
//  one number is divided by another? (one word)
//  Answer:
//  modulus

//  3. Type the modulus operator.
//  Answer:
//  %

//  4. What is the value of num?
//  var num = 20 % 6;
//  Answer:
//  2

//  5. Drag-and-drop. Holding down the left mouse button, drag the pieces of code onto 
//  the screen to form a statement that declares the variable costPerItem and assigns it 
//  the result of totalCost divided by numberOfItems.
//  Answer:
//  var costPerItem = totalCost / numberOfItems;

//  6. Click in the box and type the next character. I'll autocomplete. Don't type spaces.
//  In a single statement, declare the variable largeNum and assign it the result of 1,000 
//  multiplied by 2,000.
//  Answer:
//  var largeNum = 1000 * 2000;

//  7. Fail-safe coding. If you type the wrong character, I'll cancel the keystroke. Type spaces.
//  Assign to the variable num the result of dividing 9 by the value represented by the variable 
//  qty. The variable num hasn't been declared beforehand.
//  Answer:
//  var num = 9 / qty;

//  8. Assign to a variable the result of adding a number to itself, for example 2 + 2. 
//  The variable hasn't been declared beforehand. Make up the variable name.
//  Answer:
//  var sum = 1 + 1;

//  9. Assign to a variable the value represented by one variable subtracted from the value 
//  represented by another variable. The first variable has been declared beforehand. 
//  Make up all the variable names.
//  Answer:
//  var sum = sumOne - sumTwo;

//  10. Code an alert that displays the result of any mathematical operation on 2 variables. 
//  Make up the variable names.
//  Answer:
//  alert(sumOne + sumTwo);

//  11. Assign to a variable the remainder when one number is divided by another. 
//  The variable hasn't been declared beforehand. Make up the variable name.
//  Answer:
//  var remainder = 10 % 3;

//  12. Assign to a variable the remainder when the value represented by a variable 
//  is divided by a number. The first variable has been declared beforehand. 
//  Make up the variable names.
//  Answer:
//  var remainder = sumOne % 3;

//  13. Time goal: 20 seconds. (The timer starts when you click in the answer field.) 
//  Enter the operators, in this order, for addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
//  division, and modulus. Don't type spaces between them. 
//  (The timer starts when you click in the answer field.)
//  Answer:
//  +-*/%
  
//  14. Time goal: 25 seconds. Assign to a variable the result of adding a number to itself. 
//  The variable hasn't been declared beforehand. Make up the variable name.
//  Answer:
//  var result = 1 + 1;

//  15. Time goal: 30 seconds. Assign to a variable the value represented by one variable 
//  subtracted from the value represented by another variable. The first variable has been 
//  declared beforehand. Make up all the variable names.
//  Answer:
//  var result = varOne - varTwo;

//  16. Time goal: 30 seconds. Code an alert that displays the result of any mathematical 
//  operation on 2 variables. Make up the variable names.
//  Answer:
//  alert(sumOne + sumTwo);

//  17. Time goal: 30 seconds. Assign to a variable the remainder when one number is divided 
//  by another. The variable hasn't been declared beforehand. Make up the variable name.
//  var remainder = 10 % 3;

//  18. Time goal: 30 seconds. Assign to a variable the remainder when the value represented 
//  by a variable is divided by a number. The first variable has been declared beforehand. 
//  Make up the variable names.
//  Answer:
//  remainder = varOne % 3;

//  19. Live coding exercise: Code an alert that displays the result of a math operation on 2 numbers.
//  Type out the code. If you copy and paste it from the screen showing the correct code, it may not work.
//  Click the Run It button to run your code live.
//  Answer:
//  alert(9 * 9);

//  20. Live coding exercise: Assign numbers to 2 new variables. Code an alert that displays 
//  the result of a math operation on the variables.
//  Type out the code. If you copy and paste it from the screen showing the correct code, it may not work.
//  Click the Run It button to run your code live.
//  Answer:
//  var varOne = 5;
//  var varTwo = 10;
//  alert(varOne + varTwo);
