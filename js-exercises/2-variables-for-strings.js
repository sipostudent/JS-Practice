//  var varOne = "I love coding";

//  9. Declare a variable. (You've learned only one rule for naming variables so far, so it's the 
//  only one I'll hold you to.)
//  Answer:
//  var varOne;

//  10. Assign a string of your choice to a variable of your choice that has already been declared.

//  Answer:
//  var testOne;
//  testOne = "Microphone Check";

//  13. Time goal: 30 seconds. (The timer starts when you click in the answer field.) 
//  In a single statement declare a variable of your choice and assign a string of your 
//  choice to it. You've learned only one rule for naming variables so far, so it's the only 
//  one I'll hold you to. (The timer starts when you click in the answer field.)
//  Answer:
//  var varOne = "Test";

//  14. Time goal: 15 seconds. Declare a variable of your choice. (You've learned only one rule for naming 
//  variables so far, so it's the only one I'll hold you to.)
//  var varTwo;

//  15. Time goal: 20 seconds. Assign a string of your choice to a variable of your choice 
//  that has already been declared. (You've learned only one rule for naming variables so far, 
//  so it's the only one I'll hold you to.)
//  Answer:
//  bestMan = "Jeff";

//  16. Time goal: 20 seconds. This statement has already been coded.
//  var bestMan = "Charlie";
//  Assign the variable a new string of your choice.
//  bestMan = "Jeff";

//  17. Time goal: 35 seconds. Declare a variable of your choice without defining it. 
//  Then, in a second statement, assign it a string of your choice. (You've learned only one rule 
//  for naming variables so far, so it's the only one I'll hold you to.)
//  Answer:
//  var cheeseMaker;
//  cheeseMaker = "cuts cheese";

//  18. Time goal: 40 seconds. In the first statement declare a variable of your choice and assign

//  different string of your choice.
//  Answer:
//  var niceFruit = "Apples";
//  niceFruit = "Pears";

//  19. Live coding exercise: Declare a variable of your choice and assign it a string of your choice. 
//  Then code an alert, specifying the variable, not the string, as the message. 
//  Click the Run It button to run your code live. Type out the code, don't copy and paste it. 
//  If you copy and paste it from the screen showing the correct code, it may not work.
//  Answer:
//  var varOne = "coder";
//  alert(varOne);

//  20. Live coding exercise: Declare a variable of your choice and assign it a string that's 
//  exactly the same as the variable name, but enclosed in quotation marks so JavaScript recognizes 
//  it as a string. Then code an alert, specifying the variable, not the string, as the message. 
//  Click the Run It button to run your code live. Type out the code, don't copy and paste it. 
//  If you copy and paste it from the screen showing the correct code, it may not work.
