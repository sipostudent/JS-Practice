//  Chapter 4 - Variable Names Legal and Illegal
//  ============================================

//  1. Type the illegal character in this statement.
//  var product cost = 3.45;
//  Answer:
//  A space is an illegal character in a variable name.

//  2. Type the illegal character in this statement.
//  var P2_a%88$;
//  Answer:
//  %

//  3. Rewrite this using camelCase.
//  var Nameofband;
//  Answer:
//  var nameOfBand;

//  4. Declare a variable using nothing but all of the legal characters 
//  that aren't alphabet characters or numbers. Don't repeat any of them.
//  Answer:
//  var $_;
//  var _$;

//  5. Drag-and-drop. Holding down the left mouse button, drag the pieces of 
//  code onto the screen to form a statement that declares a variable in camelCase.
//  Answer:
//  var averageHumanIntelligence;

//  6. Click in the box and type the next character. I'll autocomplete. Don't type spaces.
//  In a single statement, declare the variable firstLegalChar and assign it a string. 
//  The string consists entirely of the first character on the keyboard in the top row that's 
//  legal in a variable name, as long as the character doesn't come first.
//  Answer:
//  var firstLegalChar = "1";

//  7. Fail-safe coding. If you type the wrong character, I'll cancel the keystroke. Type spaces.
//  Declare a variable, in camelCase, that combines the two syllables boo and hoo.
//  Answer:
//  var booHoo;

//  8. In a single statement declare a legally-named variable and assign a number to it.
//  Answer:
//  var favNum = 7;

//  9. In a single statement declare a legally-named variable and assign to it the sum of 2 
//  other legally-named variables.
//  Answer:
//  var varOne = varTwo + varThree;

//  10. Declare a variable whose name is the combination of 3 characters, in this order: a legal 
//  first character that is not a letter, a character that would be illegal as a first character, 
//  and a character that would be legal anywhere in the name.
//  Answer:
//  var _9w;

//  11. The variable boogieWoogie has already been declared. Assign to it the value of another 
//  variable, woogieBoogie.
//  Answer:
//  boogieWoogie = woogieBoogie;

//  12. Declare a variable that is a combination of your first and last names. Use camelCase.
//  Answer:
//  sipoCharles;

//  13. Time goal: 20 seconds. Declare a variable using nothing but all of the legal characters 
//  that aren't alphabet characters or numbers. Don't repeat any of them. 
//  (The timer starts when you click in the answer field.)
//  Answer:
//  var $_;

//  14. Time goal: 20 seconds. In a single statement declare a legally-named variable and 
//  assign a number to it.
//  Answer:
//  var varOne = 5;

//  15. Time goal: 30 seconds. In a single statement declare a legally-named variable and 
//  assign to it the sum of 2 other legally-named variables.
//  Answer:
//  var varOne = varTwo + varThree;

//  16. Time goal: 25 seconds. Declare a variable whose name is the combination of 3 characters, 
//  in this order: a legal first character that is not a letter, a character that would be illegal 
//  as a first character, and a character that would be legal anywhere in the name.
//  Answer:
//  var _9w;

//  17. Time goal: 30 seconds. The variable boogieWoogie has already been declared. 
//  Assign to it the value of another variable, woogieBoogie.
//  Answer:
//  boogieWoogie = woogieBoogie;

//  18. Time goal: 20 seconds. Declare a variable that is a combination of your first and last names. 
//  Use camelCase. If you have a complex name, simplify it. Use "Sarah Billings" instead of 
// "Sarah Sue Billings-Coopersmith III"
//  Answer:
//  var sipoCharles;

//  19. Live coding exercise:
//  - Declare a variable whose name is your first and last names combined, in camelCase.
