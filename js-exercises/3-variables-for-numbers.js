//  Chapter 3 - Variables for Numbers
//  =================================

//  1. You can assign a string to a variable. You can also assign a ______.
//  Answer:
//  number

//  2. If a number is enclosed in quotes, it's a ______.
//  Answer:
//  string

//  3. What kind of operation can be done on a number variable that, 
//  in one particular case, can't be done on a string variable? 
//  Answer with a 4-letter word. (It would be a five-letter word in British usage.)
//  Answer:
//  math

//  4. What is the value of orderTotal?
//  var merchTotal = 100;
//  var shippingCharge = 10;
//  var orderTotal = merchTotal + shippingCharge;
//  Answer:
//  110

//  5. Drag-and-drop. Holding down the left mouse button, drag the pieces of code 
//  onto the screen to form a statement that declares a variable and assigns a value to it.
//  Answer:
//  var niceBigNumber = 1000000;

//  6. Click in the box and type the next character. I'll autocomplete. Don't type spaces.
//  In a single statement, declare the variable numberAsString and assign the number 3 to it as a string.
//  Answer:
//  var numberAsString = "3";

//  7. Fail-safe coding. If you type the wrong character, I'll cancel the keystroke. Type spaces.
//  Assign to the variable caseQty, which has already been declared, the value 144.
//  Answer:
//  caseQty = 144;

//  8. In a single statement declare a variable and assign a number to it. 
//  (You've learned only two rules for naming variables so far—no quotes and 
//  no initial number—so they're the only ones I'll hold you to.)
//  Answer:
//  var varOne = 7;

//  9. In a single statement declare a variable and assign to it the sum of 2 other variables. 
//  (You've learned only two rules for naming variables so far, so they're the only ones I'll hold you to.)
//  Answer:
//  varOne = varTwo + varThree;

//  10. Rewrite this statement so the variable can be used in a math operation.
//  var num = "9";
//  Answer:
//  var num = 9;

//  11. Assign the sum of 2 numbers to a variable, which hasn't been declared beforehand. 
//  (You've learned only two rules for naming variables so far, so they're the only ones I'll hold you to.)
//  Answer:
//  var sum = 1 + 1;

//  12. In one statement declare a variable. In a second statement assign it the sum of 2 numbers. 
//  (You've learned only two rules for naming variables so far, so they're the only ones I'll hold you to.)
//  Answer:
//  var sum;
//  sum = 2 + 2;

//  13. Time goal: 20 seconds. (The timer starts when you click in the answer field.) In a single statement 
//  declare a variable and assign a number to it. You've learned only two rules for naming variables so 
//  far—no quotes and no initial number—so they're the only ones I'll hold you to. 
//  (The timer starts when you click in the answer field.)
//  Answer:
//  var num = 4;

//  14. Time goal: 25 seconds. In a single statement declare a variable and assign to it the sum of 2 
//  other variables. (You've learned only two rules for naming variables so far, so they're the only ones 
//  I'll hold you to.)
//  Answer:
//  var varOne = varTwo + varThree;

//  15. Time goal: 20 seconds. Rewrite this statement so the variable can be used in a math operation.
//  var num = "9";
//  Answer:
//  var num = 9;

//  16. Time goal: 30 seconds. Assign the sum of 2 numbers to a variable, which hasn't been declared 
//  beforehand. (You've learned only two rules for naming variables so far, so they're the only ones 
//  I'll hold you to.)
//  Answer:
//  var sum = 2 + 2;

//  17. Time goal: 30 seconds. In one statement declare a variable. In a second statement assign it 
//  the sum of 2 numbers. (You've learned only two rules for naming variables so far, so they're the 
//  only ones I'll hold you to.)
//  Answer:
//  var sum;
//  sum = 7 + 8;

//  18. Time goal: 35 seconds. In the first statement declare a variable and assign it a number. 
//  In the second statement, change the value of the variable by adding it together with a number.
//  Answer:
//  var num = 5;
//  num = num + 5;

//  19. Live coding exercise: Declare a variable and assign it a number. Then code an alert, 
//  specifying the variable, not the number, as the message. Click the Run It button to run your code live. 
//  Type out the code. If you copy and paste it from the screen showing the correct code, it may not work.
//  Answer:
//  var num = 5;
//  alert(num);

//  20. Live coding exercise:
//  - Declare a variable and assign it a number.
//  - Double the variable's value by adding the variable to itself.
//  - Display the variable's value in an alert, specifying the variable, not the number, as the message.
//  - Type out the code. If you copy and paste it from the screen showing the correct code, it may not work.
//  Answer:
//  var num = 4;
//  num = num + num;
//  alert(num);
