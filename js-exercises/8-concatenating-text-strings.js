//  Chapter 8 - Concatenating text strings
//  ======================================

//  1. var num = "2" + "2";
//  What is the value of num? Include quotation marks.

//  Answer:
//  "22"

//  2. What is it called when you combine two or more strings, using the plus sign?

//  4. alert("33" + 3);
//  What message displays in the alert box?

//  Answer:
//  333

//  5. Drag-and-drop. Holding down the left mouse button, drag the pieces to 
//  create a statement that assigns to saying the concatenation of the two strings.

//  Answer:
//  var saying = "upsy-" + "daisy";

//  6. Click in the box and type the next character. I'll autocomplete. Don't type spaces.
//  Write a statement that assigns to scribe the concatenation of the first and last names 
//  of England's greatest playwright. The variable hasn't been declared beforehand.

//  Answer:
//  var scribe = "William" + "Shakespeare";

//  7. Fail-safe coding. If you type the wrong character, I'll cancel the keystroke. Type spaces.
//  Write an alert that displays the concatenation of the two parts of "Woo hoo"

//  Answer:
//  alert("Woo " + "hoo");

//  8. Write a statement that assigns to a variable the concatenation of the two parts of 
//  "Oh yeah" (no period at the end). The second part is "yeah" The variable hasn't been 
//  declared beforehand.

//  Answer:
//  var concatenation = "Oh " + "yeah";

//  9. Write a statement that concatenates two variables and assigns the result to a 
//  third variable. The third variable hasn't been declared beforehand.

//  Answer:
//  var fullName = firstName + lastName;

//  10. Write a statement that displays an alert. The message is a string concatenated 
//  with a variable.

//  Answer:
//  alert("Variables are " + unique);

//  11. Write a statement that assigns to a variable the concatenation of a string with a number. 
//  The variable has been declared beforehand.

//  Answer:
//  concatenation = "Sipo is " + 34;

//  12. Assign strings to two variables. Then concatenate them and assign the result to a 
//  third variable. None of the variables have been declared beforehand.

//  Answer:
//  var firstName = "Sipo ";
//  var lastName = "Charles;
//  var fullName = firstName + lastName;

//  13. Time goal: 20 seconds. (The timer starts when you click in the answer field.)
//  message = ("Hello," + "Dolly");
//  What is the value of message? (Include the quotation marks.)

//  Answer:
//  "Hello,Dolly"

//  14. Time goal: 30 seconds. Write a statement that concatenates two variables and 
//  assigns the result to a third variable. The third variable hasn't been declared beforehand.

//  Answer:
//  var fullName = firstName + lastName;

//  15. Time goal: 35 seconds. Write a statement that displays an alert. 
//  The message is a string concatenated with a variable.

//  Answer:
//  alert("Hello " + name);

//  16. Time goal: 35 seconds. Write a statement that assigns to a variable the concatenation 
//  of a string and a number. The variable has been declared beforehand.

//  Answer:
//  age = "Sipo is " + 34;

//  17. Time goal: 40 seconds. Write a statement that assigns to scribe the concatenation 
//  of the first and last names of England's greatest playwright 
//  (including the space between them). The variable hasn't been declared beforehand.

//  Answer:
//  var scribe = "William " + "Shakespeare";

//  18. Time goal: 60 seconds. Assign strings to two variables. 
//  Then concatenate them and assign the result to a third variable. 
//  None of the variables have been declared beforehand.

//  Answer:
//  var firstName = "Sipo";
//  var lastName = "Charles";
//  var fullName = firstName + lastName;

//  19. Live coding exercise:
//  - Assign a string to a variable.
//  - Display an alert, specifying the concatenation of the variable plus a string as the message.
//  - Click the Run It button to run your code live.
//  - Type out the code. If you copy and paste it from the screen showing the correct code, it may not work.

//  Answer:
//  var greeting = "Hello ";
//  alert(greeting + "world!");

//  20. Live coding exercise:
//  - Assign two strings to two variables.
//  - Assign to a third variable the concatenation of the first two variables.
//  - Display an alert, specifying the third variable as the message.
//  - Click the Run It button to run your code live.
//  - Type out the code. If you copy and paste it from the screen showing the correct code, it may not work.

//  Answer:
//  var firstName = "Sipo ";
